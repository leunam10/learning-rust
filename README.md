# learning-rust

This repository contains the test, exercises and project made by me while learning **Rust**. 

:blue_book: In general I will follow the **Rust** book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

There are two type of folder names:

:large_blue_diamond: **Book Exercise**: in this case the exercise folder indicate the chapter and the section of the exercise.(e.g *chapter_1_[project_name]*)

:large_blue_diamond: **Personal Exercise**: in this case the exercise or project is not directly connected to the book :arrow_right: the name of the folder contains ther world *personal* (e.g. *personal_[project_name]*).
