# learning-rust

This repository contains the test, exercises and project made by me while learning **Rust**. 

:blue_book: In general I will follow the **Rust** book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

There are two type of folder names:

:large_blue_diamond: **Book Exercise**: in this case the within the exercise folder there is a folder indicating the chapter; within the chapter folder the name of the project/exercise

    ├── ...
    ├── exercise
        └── chapter_1
            └── hello_world

:large_blue_diamond: **Personal Exercise**: in this case the exercise or project is not directly connected to the book:
 
    ├── ...
    ├── exercise
        └── personal
            └── personal_hello_world
