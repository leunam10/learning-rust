# learning-rust

This repository contains the test, exercises and project made by me while learning **Rust**. 
In general I will follow the **Rust** book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html): in this case the exercise folder indicate the chapter and the section of the exercise.
If the exercise or project is not directly connected to the book, the name of the folder contains ther world *personal* (e.g. personal_[project_name]).
